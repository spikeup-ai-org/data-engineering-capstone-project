# Data Engineering Capstone Project

## Problem

The sales and marketing team specifically want to understand user behavior inorder to target the right customers with incentives. Insights of interest include  customer demographics, purchase history and inactive/active customers.  The objective of obtaining these insights is to target identified users with relevant email and promotional campaigns to drive more sales and revenue.

## Structure of project

This project is set up in steps/phases where you will incrementally achieve specific tasks related to the overall project. Below is the break down:

1. [Week 1](Week-1): Code versioning & CI/CD with Github
2. [Week 2](Week-2): Data processing with Spark ( read from raw data in cloud storage, and populate to google SQL database)
3. [Week 3 & 4](Week-3-%26-4): Orchestration with Airflow on GCP cloud composer

With each step, you will get introduced to the essential tools to set up and run a reproducible and automated data engineering project.
